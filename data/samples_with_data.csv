671,5316250,Fluid container stand for therapeutic treatments, A fluid container stand is provided having an extension member supported in an upright vertical position by an underlying base. The base is constructed from a plurality of planar base members and a plurality of planar union members.

Conventional clutches for high-speed and reverse operation of the drum shaft are replaced by switches and potentiometers. ,1981-03-03,utility,A,d7e3318c-9a7b-4461-86a2-c20472bdd50d,Cone-Blanchard Machine Company,,,0,Windsor,VT,US,1979/06087711,06/087711,US,06087711,06087711,06,1979-10-24,1981-03-03,1,B,B23,MACHINE TOOLS; METAL-WORKING NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR,B23Q,"DETAILS, COMPONENTS, OR ACCESSORIES FOR MACHINE TOOLS, e.g. ARRANGEMENTS FOR COPYING OR CONTROLLING ; MACHINE TOOLS IN GENERAL CHARACTERISED BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF PARTICULAR DETAILS OR COMPONENTS; COMBINATIONS OR ASSOCIATIONS OF METAL-WORKING MACHINES, NOT DIRECTED TO A PARTICULAR RESULT",B23Q15/225,"Automatic control or regulation of feed movement, cutting velocity or position of tool or work -before or after the tool acts upon the workpiece-Control or regulation of position of tool or workpiece-in feed control, i.e. approaching of tool or work in successive decreasing velocity steps",inventional,0,David H.,Youden,Cornish,NH,US

825,5093073,Process for the decontamination of surfaces," In this decontamination process, the surfaces contaminated with radioactive substances, in particular on components of cooling circuits in nuclear reactors, are treated in a first treatment step with an aqueous decontamination solution, containing chromic acid and permanganic acid, at a temperature in the range from 270 to 350 K, in particular at usual room temperature. The contaminated surface layers are thus oxidized by means of the permanganic acid, while the effect of the chromic acid is that the modified surface layers do not adhere firmly. In a second treatment step, the surface layers thus modified are removed by a chemical treatment in the same temperature range, as a result of dissolution, or/and removed by mechanical or hydraulic action. Aqueous solutions of organic acids are suitable for the chemical treatment in the second treatment step, it also being advantageously possible to add reducing agents and complexing agents and/or corrosion inhibitors.

Once a routing destination determination is made, the line card architecture provides for each received packet to be modified to contain new routing information and additional header data to facilitate packet transmission through the switching fabric. The line card architecture further provides for the use of bandwidth management techniques in order to buffer and enqueue each packet for transmission through the switching fabric to a corresponding destination port.
