0,6018738,0,Methods and apparatus for matching entities and for predicting an attribute of an entity based on an attribute frequency value," Matching (e.g., via correlation or similarity process) entities having attributes, some of which have associated values. The values of the attributes may be adjusted based on number of entities that have values for a particular attribute so that the values decrease as the number increases. The attributes of the entities may be harmonized and provided with default values so that entities being matched have common attributes defined by the union of the attributes of the entities being matched. The attributes of the entities may be expanded and provided with default values so that the entities being matched have attributes that neither had originally. The match values may be normalized to provide a weight value which may be used to predict an attribute value of a new entity based on known attribute values of known entities. The weight values may be tuned such that relatively high weights are amplified and relatively low weights are suppressed.

1,6025837,0,Electronic program guide with hyperlinks to target resources," An interactive entertainment system has a program provider which distributes video content programs to multiple subscribers over a distribution network. Each subscriber has a user interface unit which receives the digital video program and converts it for display on a television, monitor, or other display unit. The user interface unit has a processor and memory. An electronic programming guide (EPG) resides in the memory and is executable on the processor to organize programming information that is descriptive of the programs supplied over the interactive entertainment system. The EPG supports a user interface (UI) which visually correlates programs titles to scheduled viewing times. A hyperlink browser also resides in memory and is executable on the processor. One or more hyperlinks, which reference target resources containing interactive content related to the video programs, are integrated as part of the EPG UI. The hyperlinks can be placed in the program tiles, channel tiles, or description area, and can be situated alone or embedded within other text. When a viewer activates a hyperlink within the EPG, the user interface unit launches the browser to activate the target resource specified by the hyperlink. The data retrieved from the target resource is then displayed on the display unit. The viewer can also drag a particular program or channel label from its location within the EPG UI and drop the label at another location on the display unit. This drag-and-drop operation associates an instruction with the label that will execute in response to activation of the label. The instruction might cause the visual display unit to tune to the program or channel represented by the particular label, or to initiate procedures to record the program when it begins playing, or to jump to a related target resource, such as a Web site.

2,5794197,0,Senone tree representation and evaluation," A speech recognition method provides improved modeling in recognition accuracy using hidden Markov models. During training, the method creates a senone tree for each state of each phoneme encountered in a data set of training words. All output distributions received for a selected state of a selected phoneme in the set of training words are clustered together in a root node of a senone tree. Each node of the tree beginning with the root node is divided into two nodes by asking linguistic questions regarding the phonemes immediately to the left and right of a central phoneme of a triphone. At a predetermined point, the tree creation stops, resulting in leaves representing clustered output distributions known as senones. The senone trees allow all possible triphones to be mapped into a sequence of senones simply by traversing the senone trees associated with the central phoneme of the triphone. As a result, unseen triphones not encountered in the training data can be modeled with senones created using the triphones actually found in the training data.

4,6754386,0,Method and system of matching ink processor and recognizer word breaks,"In a computing device that receives handwritten data, a method and system that corrects for parser segmentation errors by sending an entire line of ink to a recognizer, and then comparing, on a word-by-word basis, the initial segmentation guesses of the parser with the more-thoroughly recognized segmentation results of the handwriting recognition engine. In the correction process, the ink words are efficiently adjusted with relatively little data manipulation. As the recognizer is fed a series of strokes on a line, the recognizer returns segmentation information. For ink word breaks that are the same for any given set of data, the existing ink word is unchanged. For ink words that are recognized differently relative to their initial segmentation, one or more new ink words are created and the handwriting (including stroke) data of the parser's ink word is manipulated to create a new ink processor word (or words) to match the recognizer output.",2004-06-22,utility,9e98dbf5-7cc3-42fe-a6ad-8cd62eda7372,United States company or corporation,,,Microsft Corporation,Redmond,WA,US

12,6041053,0,Technique for efficiently classifying packets using a trie-indexed hierarchy forest that accommodates wildcards,"A technique, specifically apparatus and accompanying methods, which utilizes a trie-indexed hierarchy forest (""rhizome"") that accommodates wildcards for retrieving, given a specific input key, a pattern stored in the forest that is identical to or subsumes the key. The rhizome contains a binary search trie and a hierarchy forest. The search trie provides an indexed path to each unique, most specific, pattern stored in a lowest level of the hierarchy forest and also possibly to increasingly general patterns at higher levels in the pattern hierarchy. The hierarchy forest organizes the patterns into nodal hierarchies of strictly increasing generality. For use as a packet classifier, the rhizome stores wildcard-based packet classification patterns at separate corresponding pattern nodes, along with, corresponding ""reference"" fields associated therewith. Operationally, as each different queue is established or removed, a corresponding classification pattern is either inserted into or removed from the rhizome. A search key is formed for each packet, typically by concatenating classification fields, e.g. source and destination addresses and source and destination port designations, appearing in a header of the packet. The search key is then applied to the rhizome to determine whether that key exists therein, by virtue of either matching an identical classification pattern or being completely subsumed within a more general pattern stored therein. When such a classification is found, the classifier returns the contents of the associated reference field, which for scheduling, is a designation of a transmission queue to which the packet is to be directed.",2000-03-21,utility,9e98dbf5-7cc3-42fe-a6ad-8cd62eda7372,United States company or corporation,,,Microsfot Corporation,Redmond,WA,US

The file system may have use of facilities that enable the monitoring of files/streams that have been registered for migration administration or files/streams may be polled according to preset criteria. If the stream of data has portions to migrate to another storage location, the hierarchical storage management (HSM) system migrates the data to the other storage location, such as to long term or off-line storage, and preserves the data relationships of the stream via metadata. The technique allows for multiple volumes to be spanned by the migration target location, and multiple file systems may service the source and target.",2006-07-04,utility,9e98dbf5-7cc3-42fe-a6ad-8cd62eda7372,United States company or corporation,,,Microsft Corporation,Redmond,WA,US
